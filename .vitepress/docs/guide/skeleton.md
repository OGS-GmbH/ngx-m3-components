# Skeleton component

## 1. OTP-input Component configuration
The Skeleton component serves as a placeholder to indicate that content is loading. It automatically fills 100% of the available width and height of its parent container. A built-in shimmer animation runs continuously to show that data is being fetched or processed.

## 2. Provide
Import the module/component in your Angular application:
```typescript [example.ts]
import { SkeletonModule, SkeletonComponent } from '@ogs-gmbh/ngx-m3-components';
```

## 3. Usage
Easy to use in template:
```html [example.html]
<ogs-m3-skeleton />
```
